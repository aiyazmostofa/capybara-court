* Capybara Court
A Docker image that can safely run and judge the output of untrusted Java code.

** Deployment
A Docker Compose file has been provided in the project root directory.
The server currently runs on =localhost:8080=.
Google Cloud and Terraform support will be added soon.

** Usage
Make a POST request to =/= consisting of the following multipart form:
| Name                | Type | Description                                     |
|---------------------+------+-------------------------------------------------|
| =code= (required)   | file | A Java file.                                    |
| =input=             | file | A sample input file.                            |
| =timeout=           | int  | The timeout in seconds (default is 10 seconds). |
| =output= (required) | file | A sample output file.                           |

If you receive a status code 200, that means the code has been judged, and you will receive a JSON object with these key-value pairs:
| Key             | Value Type | Description                                                 |
|-----------------+------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
| =status=        | string     | The judgement status (statuses described below).            |
| =compileOutput= | string     | The output of the compiler, regardless of compiler success. |
| =runtimeOutput= | string     | The output of the code, regardless of runtime success.      |

Here are the possible statuses:
| Status                | Description                                        |
|-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| =COMPILE_TIME_ERROR=  | The code did not compile.                          |
| =TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED= | The code did not run in the time limit             |
| =RUN_TIME_ERROR=      | The code exited with a run time error.             |
| =WRONG_ANSWER=        | The code's output did not match the sample output. |
| =CORRECT_ANSWER=      | The code's output did match the sample output.     |

** Judging Algorithm
To determine if two outputs are the same, the following algorithm is used.

For each output:
- Split the output by =\n= to get each line in a string.
- Remove all trailing or leading lines that are purely whitespace.
- Remove all trailing whitespace in the rest of the lines.

Then compare the formatted outputs.

This algorithm tries to find a balance between formatting integrity and judging fairness.

** Future: Things to Work On
- Handling large http responses. For example, a user prints as much as possible in the time limit.
- Improving judging performance.
