* Capybara Court
A docker image that can safely run and judge the output of untrusted Java code.

** Things to Work On
- Implementing a good-enough sandbox
  - Disable network access for Java
  - Limit the number of processes a sandboxed user can create
  - Limit memory usage to prevent overload
  - Disable a large portion of the filesystem (this is possibly optional)
- Handling large http responses (say a user prints as much as possible in the time limit)
- Proper documentation (code explanation, tutorials for Docker and serverless deployments, API)
- Terraform???
- Improving judging performance
